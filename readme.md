## Chingu Issue Log

We love finding and fixing errors and omissions! We also love hearing your ideas for how to improve this wiki to help make it more relevant not just for you, but for future Chingu Voyagers.

Tickets are for problems, not for questions or advice. Continue to post questions in the channels like #community-chat and #code-help. But, please open a ticket if you are experiencing a problem like a permissions issue preventing you from being able to access to your GitHub repo. 

## What Makes a Good Issue Report?

The result of having the complete, accurate, and appropriate information is the issue can be resolved faster and more correctly. The key information that should be entered into the issue are:

- **_About You_** Information such as your Voyage number (e.g. 8), Team Name, Discord Name, and Timezone. 

- **_Issue Description & Expected Outcome:_** Briefly tell us what the issue is, what you expected, and it's impact so we can properly prioritize it.

- **_Symptoms:_** Error messages and screenshots are a great way to communicate the symptoms

- **_Steps to Recreate:_** If applicable, what were the steps you performed that led to the symptom?

- **_Resolution:_** To be completed by Chingu-X team

Issues should be entered by the individual experiencing the issue. One tip is to include error messages and screenshots when describing issues since they provide the most accurate information and are quicker than typing text.

When the issue is resolved the Chingu-X team  will update the issue to describe how it was resolved, along with any supplemental information that may be useful if the issue should reoccur in the future.
